# anime-binary
**_still under development_**

This is a simple C++ binary file handling program, to keep track of the anime that i've watched and that i'm watching.

As of now it can:
  - Anime:
    - add
      - anime name
      - anime completed
        - if no: season and recent episode watched
    - update 
    - display 
    - delete 

  - Manga:
    - add
      - manga name
      - manga completed
        - if no: recent chapter read
    - update 
    - display 
    - delete


# A little insight on why i did this

It has been long since i used C++, so i thought i'd do something simple in it, just to keep in touch with the language. 

I've been watching a lot of anime recently and i was finding it difficult to keep track of what im watching and what i've watched. So i thought, "okay i'll make a text file and save the names of all the anime i've watched". But since i wanted to try out C++ again i decided that i'll make a C++ file handling program to create and write the text file. 

But then i thought why text file if i'm going to do it as a program. Even if i can't finish the program, i can just type and save the text file by myself. There would be no compulsion to finish the program.

Hence i decided, "i'll do it as a binary file program", so that i'll have no other way than to finish the program, because i cannot access that binary file if not through the program. 

Now you may ask, why binary? why so much effort when you can save it as a textfile by yourself, or use myanimelist?

Why?
Because i can.
